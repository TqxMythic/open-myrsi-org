// Table-based cron lease. Makes the in-process node-cron
// jobs in server.ts safe under multi-instance deploys: only the worker that
// holds an unexpired lease runs a given job on a given tick. pg_advisory_lock is
// unusable over PostgREST (each rpc() is a fresh connection, so the lock would
// release immediately), so this uses a lease row + expiry — see
// migrations/add-cron-locks.sql — mirroring the processed_stripe_events pattern.
//
// FAIL-OPEN: if the lease RPC itself errors (e.g. the migration hasn't been
// applied yet, or a transient DB blip), the job RUNS anyway, so the guard can
// never make a job worse than a single instance running everything
// unconditionally, and the code can deploy before the migration lands.
